                    Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir
                    Singh. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two
                    stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia. Their
                    eldest son was Amar Singh I. He belonged to the royal family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh
                    in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers
                    preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap
                    ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia
                    Rajputs.He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for
                    Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return
                    for his help.Pratap Singh, gained distinction for his refusal to form any political alliance with
                    the Mughal Empire and his resistance to Mughal domination. The conflicts between Pratap Singh and
                    Akbar led to the Battle of Haldighati.</p>
